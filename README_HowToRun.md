# README: How to Run the Code in `viva_code.ipynb`

This guide will help you run the Jupyter Notebook titled `viva_code.ipynb`.

---

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- pip (Python package manager)

### Optional: Use a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository/notebook to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

3. Install necessary dependencies (you may need to check the notebook for specific libraries):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there's no `requirements.txt`, manually install needed libraries. Common examples:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

---

## Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

2. In the browser interface, open `viva_code.ipynb`.

3. Run cells one by one using `Shift + Enter`, or run all using:
```
Kernel > Restart & Run All
```

---

## Notes

- Make sure all data files or resources used in the notebook are present in the correct directory.
- Read through any markdown cells for additional context or instructions.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If a module is not found, install it using `pip install <module-name>`.
- If kernel issues occur, try restarting the kernel from the Jupyter interface.
