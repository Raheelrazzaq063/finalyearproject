# Breast Cancer Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a breast cancer dataset to understand the underlying patterns and prepare the data for machine learning modeling. It covers data loading, cleaning, exploration, and possibly prediction steps.

## Dataset
- **File**: `breast-cancer-data.csv`
- **Description**: Contains medical measurements used for breast cancer diagnosis (e.g., tumor size, texture, smoothness).
  
## Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading**  
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.

2. **Data Inspection**
   - Viewed the first and last few rows of the dataset.
   - Checked dataset information like column names, data types, and non-null counts.
   
3. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Identified and analyzed missing values.
   - Addressed missing data appropriately (details in the notebook).

4. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicate entries.
   - Verified row and column counts after cleaning.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries and initial visualizations were performed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib (used for visualization)
  - seaborn (used for visualization)
  - scikit-learn (used for ML models and data preprocessig)

Install the necessary libraries with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially.
3. Follow comments in the code for understanding each step.
